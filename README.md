## Abstract
We propose an approach based on one-dimensional convolutional neural network for classifying four categories of ECGÔºçNormal, AF, Noise, and Others. In previous state-of-the-art researches, many of them used a spectrogram to train a neural network with a huge number of training parameters. In order to decrease the computational complexity and enhance efficiency, we developed a 1-D CNN with sequential data to make a classification. Besides, we developed an algorithm to deal with variable-length ECG recordings. We trained on two different data splits: 5-fold cross-validation and training-validation-test split. We first trained on 5-fold with grid search in order to find the optimal training parameters and evaluated F_1 score with average 5-fold. We then trained on 50:20:30 split and calculated accuracy and loss of our best model. As a result, our model obtained an F_1 score of 81.4 with 5-fold cross-validation. Our method of 1-D CNN outperformed one of the top scores using 2-D CNN from Physionet 2017 challenge.
